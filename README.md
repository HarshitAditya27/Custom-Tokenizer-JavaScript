## Introduction 🐱‍💻
- Created a custom tokenizer in JavaScript inm form of a web app that lets us build a vocabulary from text, encode sentences into token IDs, and decode them back into readable text. It features basic text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation spacing), special tokens (`<PAD>`, `<UNK>`, `<START>`, `<END>`), CSV export, and an interactive UI.
